# Sage Audio  
Projects, experiments, and examples involving audio processing, analysis, visualization, and classification using machine learning. Maintained by Emily Brown.
  
## AudioBasics  
Simple notebooks and scripts that demonstrate various basic tasks in audio processing and visualization. Developed by Emily Brown, 01/2021 - 02/2021.  
- **`Note Generator.ipynb`** - A simple notebook which uses interactive widgets to build and visualize a sound wave. 01/2021
- **`Webcam Recorder.ipynb`** - Records a short audio clip using a webcam microphone, writing it to a wave file and visualizing a waveform and a spectogram. 02/2021
- **`usbaudio.py`** - Script built for Raspberry Pi that records audio from a usb microphone and optionally plots various visualizations. 02/2021

## MusicGenre
Explorations in machine learning and music information retrieval focused on the task of genre classification. Based on work by [MichaÃ«l Defferrard, et al.](https://github.com/mdeff/fma), and [Nagesh Singh Chauhan](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/audio-data-analysis-deep-learning-python-part-1.html). 03/2021 - Current project.
- **`Genres.ipynb`** - Builds a genre classification model and makes genre predictions on user-submitted audio data.
- **`Features.ipynb`** - Extracts audio features from a subset of the [FMA dataset](https://github.com/mdeff/fma).

## Birdsong Analysis
Further explorations in audio processing and machine learning, investigating the task of detecting and classifying bird species from birdsong audio. Future project.
