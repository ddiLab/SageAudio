    "In this notebook, you will be exploring some of the ways Spotify categorizes songs by searching Spotify's music database and comparing the stats of different songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each song, Spotify tracks a number of different statistics that describe different aspects of the song's sound and mood. For example, stats like Acousticness, Energy, and Instrumentalness might have more to do with the way the song sounds, while stats like Danceability, Liveness, and Valence might have more to do with the way the song feels.\n",
    "\n",
    "How might two songs from the same genre compare in terms of these stats? What about two songs from different genres? Using this notebook, you can look up a song to see how it scores on each stat, or you can look up two songs at once to directly compare their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, first run the cell below. It loads the functions necessary to search and compare songs, as well as the dataset we'll be searching."

Songs that are reasonably popular and not extremely recent are more likely to be available."
