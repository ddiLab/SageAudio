    "\n",
    "There are a number of different features we can extract from audio data. We might describe these features as being \"low-level,\" meaning that they describe attributes that are much more related to the basic structure of sound waves, as opposed to high-level features that are closer related to our perception of sounds, like mood and genre. Often times, we can use these low-level features to describe (or predict, in our case) high-level features.\n",

    "Now that you've finalized your dataset, you must decide which features to extract from the data so that your model can train on them. you can select up to 7 distinct features to extract from your dataset. Don't worry too much about understanding what they mean - since low-level features are so far away from the high-level features our brains are built to perceive, they might sound complicated or unintuitive. All you really need to know is that these are different ways of describing audio information in a way computers are able to easily understand. Don't be afraid to experiment and try different combinations of features at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some very brief descriptions of each of the features we'll be collecting:\n",
    "- **Chroma**: Measures how much each of the 12 pitch classes (A, Bb, B, C, etc.) are present in the audio signal.\n",
    "- **Root-mean square energy**: Kind of like the \"average\" energy, or loudness, of the audio signal.\n",
    "- **Spectral centroid**: Indicates which frequency in the audio signal has the most energy, kind of like the \"center of gravity\" of the signal.\n",
    "- **Spectral bandwith**: Describes how other frequencies are related to the spectral centroid, making it useful for describing the timbre, or sound quality, of an audio signal.\n",
    "- **Spectral rolloff**: A way of measuring the shape of an audio signal.\n",
    "- **Zero-crossing rate**: Useful for distinguishing pitched signals from percussive, or unpitched, signals.\n",
    "- **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients**: Analyze the frequency content of an audio signal using methods similar to how our brains perceive frequency and pitch.\n",
