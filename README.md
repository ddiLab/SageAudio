# Sage Audio  
Projects, experiments, and examples involving audio processing, analysis, visualization, and classification using machine learning. Maintained by Emily Brown.
  
## Audio Basics  
Simple notebooks and scripts that demonstrate various basic tasks in audio processing and visualization. Developed by Emily Brown, 01/2021 - 02/2021.  
- **Note Generator.ipynb** - A simple notebook which uses interactive widgets to build and visualize a sound wave. 01/2021
- **Webcam Recorder.ipynb** - Records a short audio clip using a webcam microphone, writing it to a wave file and visualizing a waveform and a spectogram. 02/2021
- **usbaudio.py** - Script built for Raspberry Pi that records audio from a usb microphone and optionally plots various visualizations. 02/2021

## FMA Dataset
Explorations in machine learning and music information retrieval based on [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01840.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/mdeff/fma) written by Defferrard, et al. 03/2021 - Current project.

## Birdsong Analysis
Further explorations in audio processing and machine learning, investigating the task of detecting and classifying bird species from birdsong audio. Future project.
