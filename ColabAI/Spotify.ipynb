For example, stats like Acousticness, Energy, and Instrumentalness might have more to do with the way the song sounds, while stats like Danceability, Liveness, and Valence might have more to do with the way the song feels.\n","\n","How might two songs from the same genre compare in terms of these stats? What about two songs from different genres? Using this notebook, you can look up a song to see how it scores on each stat, or you can look up two songs at once to directly compare their scores.\n","\n","To use this notebook, first run the cell below to connect to Google Drive."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive/')"],"metadata":{"id":"QSryHJavpei6"},"id":"QSryHJavpei6","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["For this notebook to work, we need to upgrade the tools we'll be using to graph the Spotify stats for each song.
